        <h3>Custom Automation & Workflow Design</h3>
        <p>Stop copying and pasting data. We build custom "logic engines" using tools like n8n to connect your disparate apps. Whether it's syncing your web forms to your email marketing or automating client onboarding, we build the "digital glue" that makes your business run smoother and faster.</p>

        <h3>Network Infrastructure & Wi-Fi Optimization</h3>
        <p>Connectivity is the lifeblood of modern business. We design and install robust networks using Ubiquiti and enterprise gear. We prioritize your critical traffic (like Voice and POS) so that someone watching Netflix in the breakroom never slows down your credit card processing.</p>

        <h3>Managed Security & Compliance</h3>
        <p>Leveraging our background in banking IT, we deploy advanced firewalls, endpoint detection (EDR), and proactive monitoring (CrowdSec). We don't just wait for a virus; we actively block threats at the network level and ensure you meet compliance standards for your industry.</p>

        <h3>Strategic IT Consulting (Fractional CIO)</h3>
        <p>Every growing business needs a technology roadmap. We help you plan your IT budget for the next 1–3 years, select the right software stack, and oversee major digital transformations. We sit on your side of the table during vendor negotiations to ensure your interests are protected.</p>
